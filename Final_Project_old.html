            To Begin...
        </h2>
        <p>
            New York City is full of AirBnBs. With nearly 40,000 listings available in the city, 
            there are around 33 AirBnB listings per square mile in the city. And as we delve into 
            the AirBnB landscapes in New York, we discovered data points that portray a surprising picture 
            that defies common expectations. In this explainer, we will guide you through why Manhattan isn’t
            the ideal borough for investment, how seasonality exists in the borough disparities of 
            listing “popularity,” and the “sweet spots” of listings in terms of the number of accommodates. 
            Join us on an exploration through the unexpected as we look into the surprising insights from the
            NYC AirBnB Data.

            I. Manhattan Sucks For AirBnB Investing
        </h2>
        <p>
            Manhattan is expensive. Real estate in Manhattan is expensive. That's why people commonly consider 
            owning a property in Manhattan to be extremely lucrative. But what about for AirBnB properties? 
            Is having an AirBnB property in Manhattan good for investing?
        </p>

        <div style="margin-bottom: 0px; color:rgb(119, 118, 118)"> 
            Figure Usage: The color scheme in the map represents the level of Average Monthly Revenue per borough.

        <!-- Put iframe here -->
    
        <p>
            Surprisingly, the data says otherwise. In the interactive map, we see that Manhattan generates $4931 per month 
            for Average Monthly Revenue per Listing, which is not the highest of five boroughs. Matter of fact, 
            <b>AirBnB properties in Manhattan generate second least average monthly revenue in NYC.</b> The borough with 
            the highest Average Monthly Revenue is Staten Island ($6569), which is directly followed by Brooklyn ($6495),
            Queens ($5784), Manhattan ($4931), and Bronx ($4216). As we typically associate Manhattan and Brooklyn as the two boroughs that attract the most amount of 
            travelers, this finding is unexpecting. 
            <br><br>
            As we dig deeper by tapping into the borough on the map, we get a better picture as to why this is the case.
            If we take a closer look into each borough's listing price distribution, we see that Manhattan's price distribution 
            is much more skewed towards the right than the other 4 boroughs, as much more proportion of properties are 
            in the $150+ bins in the price distribution than any other boroughs. In other words, listings in Manhattan 
            are likely to be priced higher than listings in other boroughs (and it's not just the extremely expensive 
            listing pulling the average price up). The suggests that despite the higher pricing tendencies of AirBnBs 
            in Manhattan, the Average Monthly Revenue per Listing is lower than most other boroughs due to the smaller 
            frequency in bookings/nights stayed. <b>This suggests the insight that the AirBnB market in Manhattan may be oversaturated 
            (which makes intuitive sense, as Manhattan has the most listings).</b> Moreover, given that real estate properties 
            in Manhattan tend to be more expensive than other boroughs, we can say that Manhattan is surprisingly 
            not great for investing.

            III. Even Disparities in Listing "Popularity" have Seasonality
        </h2>
        <p>
            It's not hard to see that the demand for Airbnb has seasonality. 
            New York City is more popular as a travel destination in some seasons than others.
            However, what might surprise you is that even the 
            <b>disparity between boroughs in the nights-stayed-per-listing is seasonal.</b> 
            Take a look (and animate/use slider!) at the following interactive chart, which displays the progression of 
            average nights stayed per listing for each borough from January to October 2023 (the size of the circles 
            represen the number of listings in that borough). 
        </p>

        <div style="margin-bottom: 0px; color:rgb(119, 118, 118)"> 
            Figure Usage: Each circle represents a borough, where circle size represents the number of listings. 
            Black verticle lines represent the difference in average nights stayed per listing between the borough 
            with the highest value and the lowest value. Hover over this line to see this number. The five colored 
            lines represent the progression of average nights stayed per listing across months. Hover over the line 
            to highlight the line for a clearer view. Hover over the circle for the number of listings in the associated borough.
            <b>Tap play button or use the slider to observe how demand per listing changes for each borough by months.</b>

        <iframe width="100%" height="734" frameborder="0"
        src="https://observablehq.com/embed/96c678e26442b982@433?cells=viewof+monthFilterIndex%2CmyChartMain">
        </iframe>

        <p>
            We can see from the interactive chart that the disparities in nights-stayed-per-listing between 
            boroughs vary significantly depending on the months. In the winter, the disparity is small, with 
            February only having a 2.3-night difference in average nights stayed per listing between the borough 
            with the highest value, Manhattan, and the borough with the lowest value, Bronx (you can view this 
            information for all months by hovering over the black interval line on the chart). However, 
            as the months progress into spring, this disparity grows. By April, the gap in average nights stayed 
            per listing has doubled, reaching 4.84-night difference the amount in January. This trend continues into summer 
            and early fall, peaking in September with a substantial <b>14.4-night difference</b> between the borough with
            the highest value, Queens, and the lowest value, Manhattan. Subsequently, this gap begins to shrink, 
            with October showing a smaller (but still significant) 8-night difference in average nights stayed per
            listing between boroughs. Hence, there is a pronounced seasonality in the disparity of average nights 
            stayed per listing in NYC, reaching a point where this value <b>septuples</b> (yes, that means x7) 
            from the month with low disparity to the month with high disparity. 
            <br><br>
            Moreover, if we look at the animation/line across the months, we also notice that the boroughs with 
            higher or lower avearge nights stayed per listings are not always the same. Manhattan, a borough most 
            would associate as the most popular, starts off being as a borough with the highest average nights stayed per 
            listings in January and February, but soon gets surpassed by all other boroughs, becoming the borough with 
            lowest average nights stayed per listings from June to October. Another surprising case is Bronx, where 
            the borough is usually amongst the lowest in average nights stayed per listing with the exception of 
            August and September, where we see a huge spike that puts them in 3rd highest. Finally, Queens consistently
            has the highest average nights stayed per listings across all months, which is surprising as many would 
            expect that title to be held by Manhattan or Brooklyn (the two most iconic NYC boroughs). 
            <br><br>
            So what's the insight? Three things. (1) Manhattan likely faces an oversaturated market, and this data 
            serves as additional evidence supporting that observation (as mentioned in section I). (2) Queens appears to be the sweet spot in 
            terms of demand per listing. Therefore, having an Airbnb property in Queens may offer the best chances 
            of keeping the property consistently booked when compared to other boroughs. (3) For prospective Airbnb
            owners who are considering to lease only on specific seasons, it may be advantageous to take into account
            of the observed seasonality. If leasing only in the summer (e.g., while being out of town for summer holiday),
            Queens, Staten Island, and Brooklyn emerge as solid options. For winter leasing, Manhattan, Queens, 
            and Brooklyn are strong contenders. As for spring, Brooklyn and Queens stand out as favorable choices.
